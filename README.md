# Reactive-Hard-Real-Time---Antenna-Tracking-System-

# Abstract 
For Precise Remote Control, Communication and Navigation Telemetry Purposes of Aircrafts, beam of Directional Antennas fitted in Ground Control Station always have to be in aligned to beam of Antenna present at aircraft itself. So in order to achieve that Antenna Tracking mechanism have to be installed in Ground Control Station. In this Project, A similar tracking mechanism is physically implemented using Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi and 2 Stepper Motors and their Drivers.
